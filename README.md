This is a lightdemo showcasing Rust and Slint capabilities for making a cross-platform GUI.



To install and run, like any similar projects that use Rust and Slint for GUI development, you’ll need to set up your development environment with the following prerequisites:

1. Rust Programming Language

	•	Installation: Rust can be installed via rustup, which is Rust’s official command-line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. To install rustup and Rust, visit the Rust website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
	•	Version: Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed to avoid compatibility issues with libraries used in the project.

2. Cargo

	•	Overview: Cargo is Rust’s package manager and build system, automatically installed with Rust through rustup. It handles downloading and building of your project’s dependencies and compiles your project.
	•	Usage: Verify Cargo is installed by running cargo --version in your terminal.


Once you have these prerequisites set up, you’ll be ready to clone the repository, navigate into the project directory, and use cargo run to compile and run the application.
